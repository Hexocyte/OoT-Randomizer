UPDATED:
----------------------
11/07/21:
    Logic:
        Minor changes to OGC TOD logic, to change at_night to at_dampe_time.
    Bugfixes:
        Added market>market back alley, fixing the logic for those three locations and fixing shopsanity.


11/02/21:
    Brought up to 2.0:
        Vanilla Forest Temple
            This still needs some updates, but it's now in a much better state.
    Logic:
        Shadow Temple: Added hammerslide to cross the statue chasm before Bongo Bongo.
        Water Temple: Made the BK skip trick relevant. Made the hard bosses trick relevant to Morpha.
        Spirit Temple: Made the BK skip trick relevant. No other changes
        
    Settings:
        Rearranged some tricks. Now the order should be as follows:
            Tricks which are required for other tricks to function (e.g. damage boosts, which are required for one method of bypassing the shadow door and climbing the shadow boat, among others) will be at the top.
            General-use tricks (those with several areas of application, e.g. megaflips) will be next.
            Tricks that are extremely similar in function (e.g. the BK skips) will be grouped together.
            Tricks will be kept in a general ascending difficulty within these groups, except those which have a more logical grouping (e.g. the BK skips are ordered based on their dungeon order, not based on difficulty).
        I've also updated the tags on several tricks.
            A notable new tag is the "Component" tag, which indicates tricks which must be in logic for certain other tricks to function.
    New glitches:
        None
        
    Other changes:
        Updated world.py to make it so that SoA can be in barren areas when not used for hints.
        Fixed a few bugs
