    # These are the glitchless notes:
    #
    # Boss and boss door logic.
    # This is separated from individual dungeons because region names must match between normal/MQ
    # And there are no differences in boss rooms between normal/MQ as they are separate areas.
    #
    # Key requirements (i.e. the only requirements for actually opening the boss door)
    # belong on the door->boss connection.  Any other requirements for reaching the boss door
    # belong in the respective dungeon's logic json
    #
    # 8-10 need to be ignored - because of BK skips, we need to put the BK requirement on the dungeon exits.
    # ER/logic shuffle the boss door<>boss room connections. It's fine to target the boss door as the destination for BK skips.
    # "Boss door" represents the dungeon side of the loading zone. "Boss Room" represents the boss side of it.
